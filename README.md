# DataMiningProject
## Hepatitis C Prediction & Classification Framework
- Developed a comprehensive data mining framework in **Java** using the **Weka** library to classify Hepatitis C stages including Hepatitis, Fibrosis, and Cirrhosis based on laboratory and demographic data.
- Designed a robust preprocessing pipeline featuring **SMOTE** for class imbalance handling, **Interquartile Range (IQR)** for outlier detection, and class-based missing value imputation.
- Implemented and optimized multiple machine learning models such as **J48**, **Naive Bayes**, **Logistic Regression**, and **Random Forest** using hyperparameter tuning and **10-fold cross-validation**.
- Achieved a peak validation accuracy of **93.22%** with the **Random Forest** model, demonstrating strong effectiveness for real-world medical diagnosis applications.
